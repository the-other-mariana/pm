## Negotiation techniques

- Be prepared
Leaders need to do their homework. They need to research the client or potential employee in advance, and leaders need to know what they want out of the deal using data.

- Make the first Move
When brokering a deal, the person on the offensive has the advantage. They have control of the negotiation.

- Leave Ego at the door
The best negotiatiors convince the other side that the deal was their idea. Their relationship between the two sides will more easily flourish when the client feels as though he or she 'won' the negotiations.

- Listen, listen, listen
Make questions, you do not look foolish. It also makes you feel intelligent.

- Be prepared to give up something
- Don't be afraid to ask
- Stick to your principles
Leaders operate with personal and company guidelines that shouldn't be compromised.
- Use emotional intelligence: the ability to manage emotions and show empathy towards your opposite.
- Offer and expect commitment: follow through.

## 10 hardball tactics in negotiation to watch out for: be careful

1. extreme demands followed up by small, slow concessions.
2. Commitment tactics: when you try to convince someone, when they tell you that it's not up to them.
3. Take-it-or-leave-it neg strategy.
4. Inviting unreciprocated offers: when you make an offer, you may find that the counterpart asks you to make a concession before making a counteroffer herself.
5. Trying to make you flinch: your opponent keeps making greater and greater demands, waiting for your breaking point and concede.
6. Personal insults: if you hear them, provoke awkward silences. Don't speak at all.
7. Lying: exaggerating and misrepresenting facts can throw you off guard. Be skeptical about claims.
8. Threats and warning: recognize threats, and sometimes you should ignore them.
9. Belittling your alternatives: the other party might try to make you cave in by do this. Don't let her shake your resolve.
10. Good cop, bad cop. When facing off with a two-negotiator team, don't see one as good and bad. Realize that they are working together.
